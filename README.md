# Numpy
Python library

NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python.
Here are some key points about NumPy:

1.Core Object - ndarray: The main object in NumPy is the ndarray, which is a multidimensional array of elements all of the same type. These arrays allow for efficient storage and manipulation of large datasets.
2.Array Creation: You can create arrays using functions like numpy.array(), numpy.zeros(), numpy.ones(), and numpy.arange(), among others.
3.Mathematical Functions: NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on arrays, including element-wise operations, linear algebra functions, statistical functions, and more.
4.Indexing and Slicing: NumPy arrays can be indexed and sliced in various ways, including basic slicing, advanced indexing, and boolean indexing, allowing for flexible data manipulation.
5.Broadcasting: This feature allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes in a way that would be mathematically compatible.
6.Integration with Other Libraries: NumPy is the foundational library for many other scientific and data analysis libraries in Python, such as SciPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.
7.Performance: NumPy is implemented in C, making it much faster for numerical operations than standard Python lists.
